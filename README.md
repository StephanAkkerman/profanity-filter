## Introduction

This project provides a profanity filter that supports multiple languages. It is designed to be easy to use and integrate into various applications. The filter uses a comprehensive list of profane words for each supported language, allowing it to effectively identify and filter out inappropriate content.

It uses the [List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, and Otherwise Bad Words](https://github.com/LDNOOBWV2/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words_V2) as its primary source for profane words, which is a widely used repository of such words in multiple languages.
